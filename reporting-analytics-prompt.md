# Reporting and Analytics

## Purpose
To provide a comprehensive analytics dashboard that offers insights into system performance, human grader productivity, LLM accuracy, and overall efficiency of the product categorization and attribute mapping process. This feature will enable data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement of the system.

## User Stories
- As an admin, I want to view overall system performance metrics.
- As an admin, I want to analyze human grader performance and productivity.
- As an admin, I want to compare the accuracy and efficiency of different LLM models and prompts.
- As an admin, I want to identify trends in product categorization and attribute mapping.
- As an admin, I want to export raw data and reports for further analysis.
- As a human grader, I want to view my personal performance metrics and progress over time.

## Data Requirements
- Use existing tables: products, product_attributes, users, grader_performance, llm_performance, generation_sessions
- Add new table for storing aggregated daily metrics:

```sql
CREATE TABLE daily_metrics (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  total_products_processed INTEGER NOT NULL,
  average_processing_time DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  overall_accuracy DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
  llm_accuracy DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
  human_accuracy DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
  token_usage INTEGER NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(date)
);
```

## Interactions with Other Features
- Human Grader Interface: Receives data on grader performance and corrections
- Product Generator: Provides data on LLM performance and product generation metrics
- Prompt Management: Supplies data on prompt effectiveness and A/B test results
- Admin Panel: Integrates with the overall admin interface for system-wide analytics

## State Management
- Global State:
  - currentDateRange: Object containing selected start and end dates
  - selectedFilters: Object containing active filters for data analysis
- Local State:
  - chartData: Object containing processed data for various charts
  - isLoading: Boolean indicating if data is being fetched
  - exportProgress: Number indicating progress of data export

## Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries to catch and display errors without crashing the app
- Handle network errors when fetching analytics data
- Provide clear error messages for invalid date ranges or filter combinations
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed data fetches

## Performance Considerations
- Implement data caching for frequently accessed metrics
- Use server-side aggregation for large datasets
- Implement lazy loading for chart components
- Optimize database queries for complex analytics calculations
- Use web workers for heavy client-side data processing

## Accessibility Requirements
- Ensure all charts have proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Provide keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Include text alternatives for all visual representations of data
- Ensure color schemes are accessible for color-blind users
- Implement screen reader support for data tables and exports

## Testing Requirements
- Unit Tests:
  - Test individual chart components
  - Test utility functions for data processing and calculations
- Integration Tests:
  - Test data fetching and state management
  - Test filter and date range interactions
- E2E Tests:
  - Test the complete flow of generating reports and exporting data
  - Test responsiveness and performance with large datasets
  - Test accessibility using automated tools

## Documentation
- Create user guides for interpreting different analytics metrics
- Document the methodology for calculating complex metrics
- Provide guidelines for using analytics data to improve system performance
- Create tutorials for creating custom reports and exports

## Security Considerations
- Implement proper access controls to ensure users only see authorized data
- Sanitize all user inputs for custom report generation
- Implement rate limiting for data export and report generation features
- Ensure all data transmissions are encrypted

## Future Considerations
- Implement predictive analytics for forecasting future performance
- Develop custom alert systems for anomaly detection
- Create a recommendation engine for system optimization based on analytics data
- Implement real-time analytics for critical metrics
- Develop integrations with external business intelligence tools

## Data Visualization Best Practices
- Use appropriate chart types for different data sets (e.g., line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons)
- Implement interactive tooltips for detailed data points
- Provide options for different visualization styles (e.g., light/dark themes)
- Ensure all charts are responsive and mobile-friendly
- Implement drill-down capabilities for exploring detailed data
