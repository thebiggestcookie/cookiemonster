# Admin Panel

## Purpose
To provide a centralized interface for system administrators to manage users, configure LLM settings, monitor system performance, and control all aspects of the LLM Product Categorizer and Attribute Mapping System. The Admin Panel should offer a comprehensive set of tools for efficient system management while ensuring security and scalability.

## User Stories
- As an admin, I want to manage user accounts and permissions.
- As an admin, I want to configure and manage LLM providers and models.
- As an admin, I want to monitor system health and performance in real-time.
- As an admin, I want to manage global system settings and configurations.
- As an admin, I want to view and manage the product categorization hierarchy.
- As an admin, I want to access and manage all other features of the system from a central location.

## Data Requirements
- Use existing tables: users, llm_configs, departments, categories, subcategories
- Add new tables for user roles and system settings:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  permissions JSONB NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE system_settings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  setting_key VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  setting_value TEXT NOT NULL,
  data_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  is_encrypted BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

## Interactions with Other Features
- User Management: Interacts with all features for access control and permissions
- LLM Configuration: Connects with Product Generator and Prompt Management features
- Category Hierarchy Manager: Interacts with Attribute Manager and Product Generator
- System Settings: Affects behavior across all features of the system
- Feature Access Links: Provides quick access to all major features of the system

## State Management
- Global State:
  - currentUser: Object containing information about the logged-in admin
  - systemHealth: Object containing real-time system health metrics
  - globalSettings: Object containing current system settings
- Local State:
  - selectedUser: Object containing details of the user being edited
  - selectedRole: Object containing details of the role being edited
  - categoryHierarchy: Object representing the current state of the category hierarchy

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- Display user-friendly error messages for various error scenarios
- Implement confirmation dialogs for critical actions (e.g., user deletion, role modification)
- Log detailed error information for debugging purposes

## Performance Considerations
- Implement pagination and infinite scrolling for long lists (users, logs, etc.)
- Use caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., roles, system settings)
- Optimize database queries for complex operations (e.g., user permission checks)
- Implement websockets for real-time system health updates

## Accessibility Requirements
- Ensure all forms and interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Use ARIA labels and descriptions for complex UI components
- Implement proper focus management for modal dialogs and form submissions
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 guidelines for all text and UI elements

## Testing Requirements
- Unit Tests:
  - Test individual components (UserEditor, RoleManager, SystemHealthOverview)
  - Test utility functions for permission checks and data formatting
- Integration Tests:
  - Test user creation and role assignment flow
  - Test system settings update and validation
- E2E Tests:
  - Test the complete admin panel navigation and functionality
  - Test critical workflows like user management and system configuration
  - Test accessibility using automated tools

## Documentation
- Create comprehensive documentation for all admin panel features
- Provide step-by-step guides for common administrative tasks
- Document best practices for user role and permission management
- Create troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Security Considerations
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., 2FA for admin accounts)
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for all admin panel features
- Implement audit logging for all critical actions performed in the admin panel
- Ensure all sensitive data (e.g., API keys) are encrypted at rest and in transit

## Future Considerations
- Develop a customizable dashboard for admins to pin frequently used features
- Implement a system backup and restore feature
- Create an admin activity timeline for better audit trails
- Develop a notification system for critical system events or threshold alerts
- Implement a feature flag system for gradual rollout of new features

## Localization
- Implement multi-language support for the admin panel
- Allow admins to set default language preferences for the entire system
- Provide language-specific resources for error messages and help documentation
