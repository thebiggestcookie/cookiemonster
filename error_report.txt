I apologize, but I still don't have access to any files in the repository. The <files> section in the task description remains empty. This issue persists regardless of whether the repository is private or public.

To resolve this, please ensure that:
1. The files are actually present in the repository.
2. The files are correctly listed within the <files> tags in the task description.
3. There are no permission issues preventing access to the files.

Once the files are properly included and accessible, I'll be able to analyze them and provide the requested information about their titles and contents.
